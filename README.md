Spam bots are designed to automatically send messages in Discord servers or direct messages (DMs).
They can spam text messages, emojis, and commands in your Discord server.
Some spam bots can also automatically join servers.
Their goal is to spread unwanted content or disrupt server operations.

If Discord thinks a direct message came from a spam bot, it can filter that DM into a more hidden “spam” folder.
Before you can chat directly with the requester, you must approve the message request.
You can find the Spam folder in the Message Requests view, where you can view user profiles, check shared servers, and accept or report spam folder message requests.
